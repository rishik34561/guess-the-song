Welcome to Guess the Song!

Project URL: https://gritty-beats-react.herokuapp.com

The Flask backend code for this project can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/rishik34561/Gritty-Beats

This web application (developed using ReactJS for the frontend and Flask for the backend) is a game in which users can choose a genre of music and are then provided with an audio sample of a random song pulled using the Billboard API. The player is then given four possible options from which to choose the correct song from, and his/her score will change based on whether the answer is correct or not.
